## Comparing Model Performance

My method(s) to compare models before and after conversion to Intermediate Representations
were...

The difference between model accuracy pre- and post-conversion was 76% and 69%, that is a 7% difference in accuracy

The size of the model pre- and post-conversion was 66.4 MB before and 64.2 MB after, which is a 2.2 MB difference

The inference time of the model pre- and post-conversion was 0.8 s before and 0.73 s after, which is a 0.07 s difference

## Assess Model Use Cases

Some of the potential use cases of the people counter app are...

Each of these use cases would be useful because...

## Assess Effects on End User Needs

Lighting, model accuracy, and camera focal length/image size have different effects on a
deployed edge model. The potential effects of each of these are as follows...
